## Projects

Some of the interesting things that I have built/contributed to.

- **Open-WBO-Inc** [<IconCodiconCode />](https://github.com/sbjoshi/Open-WBO-Inc)\
  Open-WBO-Inc is a partial incomplete MaxSAT solver built on top of Open-WBO. Open-WBO is an extensible and modular open-source MaxSAT solver. Open-WBO-Inc got 1st place in 60s timeout track and 2nd place in 300s timeout track at MaxSAT Evaluations 2018.
- **UTVPI-OA** [<IconCodiconCode />](https://github.com/IITH-Compilers/UTVPI-OA)\
  Implementation of algorithms to compute overapproximations of polyhedra based on Linear Programming and Fourier-Motzkin elimination.
- **Timetabler** [<IconCodiconCode />](https://github.com/sukrutrao/Timetabler) [<IconCodiconBook />](https://timetabler.readthedocs.io/)\
  A customizable timetabling software for educational institutions that encodes timetabling constraints as a SAT formula and solves them using a MaxSAT solver.
- **Autojudge** [<IconCodiconCode />](https://github.com/vbsinha/autojudge) [<IconCodiconBook />](https://autojudge.readthedocs.io/)\
  An implementation of an online judge that can be used for conducting programming contests as well as managing assignments in a university.
